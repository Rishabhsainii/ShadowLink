# üïµÔ∏è ShadowLink 

**ShadowLink** is a modern web reconnaissance tool designed to discover and analyze hidden, sensitive, and potentially risky endpoints in any web application.  
It uses a hybrid approach of HTML/JS parsing, robots.txt/sitemap analysis, and smart scoring ‚Äî and is ready to integrate AI for attack surface prediction.

## üö® Why ShadowLink?

Most scanners only look for known paths or basic HTML links.  
But real-world attackers use patterns, naming logic, and guessable endpoints to find hidden attack surfaces.

ShadowLink tries to **simulate that mindset** with:
- Static analysis + heuristic scoring
- Optional AI logic
- Detailed reporting (HTML + dashboard)
